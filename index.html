                            You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and
                            stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                            work. That's why I am learning and mastering web
                            development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                            Development Hero.

                            I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can
                            build any simple website. I can even teach my
                            grandma how to make simple website. My goal is to
                            build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

                            I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know
                            everything needed to make a website function,
                            efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond
                            with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
                            JS. I even know the deployment, server and security.
                            I will give you 100% web solution.

                            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a
                            remove web developer. I made their website and
                            showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the
                            content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
